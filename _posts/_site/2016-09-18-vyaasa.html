<p>Do you see those names in green and yellow colored boxes. They are the ones who fought this epic battle.</p>

<p>The Mahabharata is an epic narrative of the Kurukshetra War and the fates of the Kaurava and the Pandava princes. It also contains philosophical and devotional material, such as a discussion of the four “goals of life” or purusharthas.</p>

<p>The <strong>Mahabharata</strong> is the longest known epic poem and has been described as “the longest poem ever written”. Its longest version consists of over 100,000 shloka or over 200,000 individual verse lines (each shloka is a couplet), and long prose passages. About 1.8 million words in total, the Mahabharata is roughly ten times the length of the Iliad and the Odyssey combined. <strong>W. J. Johnson</strong> has compared the importance of the Mahabharata in the context of world civilization to that of the <strong>Bible</strong>, the works of <strong>Shakespeare</strong>, the works of <strong>Homer</strong>, <strong>Greek drama</strong>, or the <strong>Qur’an</strong>.</p>
